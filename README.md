# 4-Bit-Logisim-computer

Uses the logisim circuit logic to simulate a 4 bit computer. 

Computer architecture is still work in progress. 

It is half microinstructions and half full logic instruction sets with an 8 bit bus. 
VRAM and graphical views to be implemented later on once the logic is set in place.

Division is performed using additive subtraction, and everything else works with implemented logic in the adder.
